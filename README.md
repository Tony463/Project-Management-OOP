# Project Management Application

## Description

The project management application which is in this repository has some simple functionalities such as: creating and modifying projects, displaying the cost of a project, ROI indicator and daily balance. It also enables the user to add, remove or change tasks and display in an organized manner information about the projects. In other words, the app helps the user to understand data about projects, gives some financial insights and helps tracking the progress. The classes behind the application are 3: Project, Task and Resource. Every project consists of a succession of tasks and each task requires multiple resources in order to be accomplished. The operators overloading, the composition of classes and the methods rely on the simple structure mentioned earlier.


## Functionalities

We have the following functionalities:
- A simple menu in the terminal which helps the user to interact with the functionalities of the application (it relies on a switch statement with multiple cases)
- The ability to create and read projects from a file and display them (the file input_project from this repo can be given as input)
- The ability to display the cost of a project, the ROI indicator and daily balance  
- The ability to manage the tasks which are part of a project (we can add, remove or change tasks dinamically, tracking the progress of the project)
